            <p>Believe it or not, you're currently looking at this project right now! This project is
                the website you're currently reading! I've created various websites before using templates
                or website builders, and more recently with wordpress and divitheme on
                <a href="https://custom3dmade.com">custom3dmade.com</a>, however I never really knew
                anything about the raw HTML and CSS. During my first year at OSU, we had to write a little
                bit of HTML as part of some projects, and I discovered how simple it was! I decided to 
                create this website as a place for me to keep a blog, show off my projects, and to have
                a signle place where I can point people to who want to know more about me, or see more
                of what I do.
